# PCA Launch Control

A community web platform for the Porsche Club of America Rocky Mountain Region — autocross results, season standings, and event media.

**Live at [launchcontrol.club](https://launchcontrol.club)** — see the 2026 RMR season standings, per-event leaderboards, and driver progression charts.

## What's here

- Per-event leaderboards (raw, PAX, and per-class)
- Season-long points standings (best 4 of 7 events per class)
- Per-driver progression charts across the season
- SmugMug event gallery links (RMR-configured for MVP; extensible to any SmugMug-using club)
- MSR single-sign-on (coming — blocked on MotorsportReg credentials)
